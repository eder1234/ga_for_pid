# Genetic Algorithm for PID Tuning

This document describes how a Genetic Algorithm can be used to tune a PID controller.

## Algorithm

```plaintext
1. Initialize a population of PID parameters

2. For each generation do:
    1. For each individual in the population:
        1. Apply PID parameters to the system
        2. Calculate error based on the system's performance
        3. Assign fitness based on the error
    
    2. Select the best-performing individuals for reproduction
    3. Generate offspring by crossover of parent parameters
    4. Apply mutation to some offspring
    5. Replace the population with the offspring

3. Return the best individual from the final population
```

## Explanation

In the above algorithm:

- "Applying PID parameters to the system" means running the system with a PID controller that uses the given parameters.
- The "error" is a measure of how far the system's output is from the desired output.
- The "fitness" is a measure of how good the parameters are, usually, lower error means higher fitness.
- "Crossover" and "mutation" are the methods of creating variation in the population.
- The "best individual from the final population" represents the best set of PID parameters found by the Genetic Algorithm.

## Conclusion

This simple Genetic Algorithm provides a heuristic to tune a PID controller. It might not be the most efficient or effective method for all scenarios, but it serves as a decent starting point for optimization problems.
